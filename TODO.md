## � Phase 1: Foundation & Security (Current Focus)
*The objective is to move from a mock frontend to a state-persisted gateway.*

- [x] **Core UI/UX Shell**: High-fidelity landing, modules, and architecture pages.
- [x] **Branding Integration**: Professional vector-based logo and cohesive identity.
- [x] **Global Auth Context**: Session persistence and administrative profile mockups.
- [ ] **[PRIORITY] Backend API Foundation** (NestJS)
    - [ ] Real JWT-based authentication system.
    - [ ] PostgreSQL schema implementation for Households and Members.
    - [ ] Dynamic API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) integration.
- [ ] **[SECURITY] Protected Routing**
    - [ ] Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) middleware.
    - [ ] Administrative audit log for all data access.

## 🟡 Phase 2: Intelligence & Real-time Monitoring
*The objective is to operationalize the "Intelligence" in SAMPARK.*

- [ ] **AI-Driven MPI scoring** (Python/PyTorch)
    - [ ] Deploy Random Forest & CNN ensemble as microservices.
    - [ ] Automated scoring based on 12 multidimensional indicators.
- [ ] **GIS & Spatial Mapping**
    - [ ] Integration with Bhuvan (ISRO) or Mapbox for village-level spatial analytics.
    - [ ] Heatmaps for poverty density and infrastructure gaps.
- [ ] **Real-world Verification Flow**
    - [ ] Frontline worker "Ground-truth" verification module with offline sync.

## 🟠 Phase 3: Zero-Leakage Delivery & Web3
*The objective is to ensure 100% transparency in welfare delivery.*

- [ ] **Vishvasya Blockchain Integration**
    - [ ] On-chain recording of benefit eligibility.
    - [ ] Smart contracts for automated, parameter-based welfare dispersal.
- [ ] **ABHA ID & ABDM Sync**
